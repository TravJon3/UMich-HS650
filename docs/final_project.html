<p>
The PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) began in 1968, studying over 18,000 individuals living in 5,000 families. In 1997, the PSID launched the CDS (Child Development Supplement) I-III studying the children of these families. The TAS (Transition into Adulthood Supplement) began in 2005 which collected data from these very children transitioning into young adults. The following data is a custom dataset composed of the CDSII (children interviewed in 2001) and follows these children in the TAS 2011.
</p>
<p>
Want to know (i.e. dependent variable) “change” = 2 (desirable move/state) vs 0 (steady but not ideal move/state) &amp; 1 (undesirable move/state)
</p>
<p>
The questions I’m looking to answer are
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What model makes the best prediction for teens that flourish?</b></li>
<li><b>What are the best predictors?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
These are the methods of approaches I have considered to analyze the data
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use feature selection models (Boruta and Stepwise Feature Selection) given the nature of my study.</li>
<li>Use clustering nearest neighbors (kNN, k-Means) using one-hot encoding because via clustering I can determine the trends within the clusters that may be predictive in nature. (and check with SVM.) — not sure</li>
<li>Compare with apriori techniques.</li>
<li>I chose not to use classification trees or any machine learning algorithms that were obtuse and did not reveal the nature of the model because again the nature of my study.</li>
<li>I chose to minimize the use of linear modeling / regression d/t the data being nominal in nature and one-hot encoding dealing only with binary data, making the modeling trivial and useless.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="dataset-details" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1 number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Dataset Details</h1>
<p>
The following dataset I am analyzing is a filtered version of a <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/143381/version/V1/view">custom dataset</a> Dr. Ashley Palmer compiled from a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-11985-014">study done by Dr. Corey Keyes in 2006</a> using the CDSII data.
</p>
<p>
Some features were removed from Dr. Palmer’s custom dataset because they were derived from the original CDSII and TAS2011 questions that are used to create the “change” features - the features that I am studying.
</p>
<p>
In the effort to factorialize “mhstatus” and “change” I had to either remove the missing values, or account for them. Since there is no way to determine whether a missing value indicates a languishing status (perhaps due to the incomplete nature of the survey) or an incomplete status, I chose to remove them as my main focus is what features aid in positive changes. As such, by removing 30% or 835 participant surveys, the data is heavily skewed toward those experiencing positive changes.
</p>
<p>
Upon removing the missing data, I have removed the data being skewed toward stable but unideal states and states of decline. For this reason I did not need to do any sort of miniority boosting or downsampling the majority sample via SMOTE.
<p>
Some data had some NA and I will determine the appropriateness of imputing the missing values. Simply removing all observations with NA as a feature leaves us with no data to analyze. So the question is whether imputation or substituting NA’s with a dummy value is appropriate.
<p>
I also created a separate dataset containing only objective data, as through my modeling, I noticed a lot of the subjective indicators were strongly influencing the outcomes. I wanted to see what was contributing to these subjective indicators, so I created a dataset of only “objective” features.
</p>
<p>
Many features are nominal, making it inappropriate to scale the features. FIX THIS……..With roughly 300 features that are similar in nature…….FIX THIS
